Connecting a Namecheap domain to your BitBlox landing page
=======

If you purchased a domain from Namecheap, you can use it for your BitBlox landing page by following a process called domain mapping. In this process, you'll change a few settings in your Namecheap account to tell the domain where to point. This guide will walk you through the steps.

To follow this guide, you should already have an active domain with Namecheap. Once you connect your domain by following the steps in this guide, you must leave it registered with Namecheap to keep it connected to your BitBlox landing page.

    .. note::

Step 1 - Open the Domains panel
-------

The new class inherits some usefull methods like:

* ``get_tag()`` - returns the shortcode's tag.
* ``get_declared_path($rel_path = '')`` - returns the path to where the shortcode folder was declared.
* ``get_declared_URI($rel_path = '')`` - returns the uri to where shortcode folder was declared.
* ``locate_path($rel_path = '')`` - searches a rel path given as an argument first in child theme then in parent theme and last in framework. Returns the found path or false if not found. See :ref:`overwriting <overwriting-shortcodes>` for more details.
* ``locate_URI($rel_path = '')`` - does the same as `locate_path` with uris.
* ``get_config($key = null)`` - returns the shortcode's whole :ref:`overwritten <overwriting-shortcodes>` config array, or just a particular key of it's given as an argument.
* ``get_options()`` - returns the shortcode's :ref:`overwritten <overwriting-shortcodes>` options array, if there is any.


There are three places where the shortcode files are searched until found: child theme (if active), parent theme and framework.

* ``Login`` to your BitBlox ``Account`` then click ``Edit Site``.

Getting Started
===============

`Unyson`_ is a framework for `WordPress`_ that facilitates development of a theme.
This framework was created from the ground up by the team behind `ThemeFuse`_
from the desire to empower developers to build outstanding WordPress themes fast and easy.

.. note::

    This documentation assumes you have a working knowledge of WordPress.
    If you haven't, please start by reading `WordPress Documentation`_.

--------------------

* WordPress 4.3 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater

Install as plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest (recommended) way to install the framework, is through the 'Plugins' menu:
Search for plugin named ``Unyson`` and click the Install button.

Or you can install `the plugin <https://wordpress.org/plugins/unyson/>`__ manually:

1. Upload the ``unyson`` folder to the ``/wp-content/plugins/`` directory
2. Activate the Unyson plugin through the 'Plugins' menu
3. Configure the plugin by going to the Unyson menu

Install anywhere
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The framework can be placed in any directory you want, just include the ``bootstrap.php`` file.

.. note::

    You can include the ``bootstrap.php`` file multiple times,
    however only the first included version will be active,
    all other includes will be ignored/inactive.

The only thing you will have to configure is the framework directory uri, for the static files to be enqueued properly:

.. code-block:: php

    if (defined('FW')):
        // the framework was already included in another place, so this version will be inactive/ignored
    else:
        /** @internal */
        function _filter_fw_framework_plugin_directory_uri() {
            return 'https://.../uri/to/this/directory' . '/framework';
        }
        add_filter('fw_framework_directory_uri', '_filter_fw_framework_plugin_directory_uri');

        require dirname(__FILE__) .'/framework/bootstrap.php';
    endif;

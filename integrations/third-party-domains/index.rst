Understanding domains
-----
A domain or domain name is the location of a Landing Page. Your domain name is a key part of your online address and is what your visitors will use to find you easily. Your domain name is unique to you, once you have registered it, nobody else can register the same one for as long as you continue to renew it. 
Your BitBlox Landing Page may have a built-in BitBlox subdomain (mylandingpage.bitblox.me) or you can replace with a custom domain from a third-party provider.
	
	


Using a third-party domain 
----



If you purchased a domain from a third-pary provider (like GoDaddy, Namecheap or BlueHost), you can connect it to your landing page throught the process called domain mapping. Domain mapping is the process of pointing a registered domain name, like www.mylandingpage.com to your new project on BitBlox platform.
In order to use Domain Mapping, your registrar must support Custom DNS services. Custom DNS gives you control over the DNS records that describe your domain, including the CNAME. For Domain Mapping you  must have the ability to create and modify CNAME records.



Before you begin
-----

To follow this guide, you should already have registered a domain with a third-party provider. Once you connect your domain by following the steps in this guide, you must leave it registered with your provider to keep it connected to your BitBlox Landing Page.

1. Your domain provider must offer full DNS access. If they don't, you’ll need to transfer the domain to a new provider before connecting it to BitBlox.
2. You'll need to use your domain provider's default nameservers to successfully connect your domain to your BitBlox Landing Page.
3. If you have an email account linked to your custom domain, you can keep using it after connecting to BitBlox.
4. You can't connect a custom domain to BitBlox if the domain name has the word "BitBlox" in it.
5. Domains with special characters (such as ü, é, ñ) may not display properly on all browsers. If a browser can’t display the character, it will reformat the domain with extra characters and dashes. For example, the domain “übercool.de,” redirects to "xn--bercool-m2a.de” in unsupported browsers.

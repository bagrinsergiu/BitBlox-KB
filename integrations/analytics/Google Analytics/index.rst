Integrating Landing Pages with Google Analytics
=====================



When you integrate Google Analytics with BitBlox, you can get a quick idea of what customers are looking for in your landing page, which information get the most traffic, and where your customers spend their time in your landing page. You can use this information to drive content in your pages.

To integrate Google Analytics with your landing page, you'll first have to create a new property in your Analytics account:

1. You can do this from the **Admin** section after you login to Google Analytics
2. Click on **Create a new property** under any of your existing accounts. If this is the first time you're using Google Analytics, you'll have to set up a new account and the create a new property.

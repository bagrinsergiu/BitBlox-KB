Integrating Landing Pages with Google Analytics
=====================

You can easily integrate your BitBlox project with Google Analytics accross a domain using a simple dropdown list in **Script Manager**


As an alternative from our Script Manager option, it's possible to follow a manual method of integrating with Google Analytics on your landing pages. This comes in handy with use cases that require customization to the Google Analytics script. Some examples of these use cases are:

Display feature tracking
Custom dimensions
Opting out of automated tracking
Anonymize specific IP addresses in Google Analytics
The following video and article will teach you everything you need to know to embed Google Analytics tracking into your Unbounce landing pages.


1. Log in to your Google Analytics account
2. Click the Admin button in the Google Analytics toolbar
3. Select the Account you're working with
4. Select the Property (site) you're working with
5. Click  Tracking Info
6. Select and copy the tracking code then return to Unbounce
7. Paste the tracking code into your landing page's Javascript library (Select 'Head' for placement)
8. If using a Form Confirmation Dialog, paste the tracking code into your confirmation dialog as well (Select 'Head' for placement)
9. Save and republish your page

That's it! Google Analytics will then begin tracking metrics for your landing pages.

Note: Active visitors on your page will be immediately visible in your 'Real-Time' reports. The full visitor data will eventually populate to the rest of the reports about 24 hours later.

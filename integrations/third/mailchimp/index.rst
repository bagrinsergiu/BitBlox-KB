MailChimp's double opt-in policy
------

As part of MailChimp's double opt-in process, visitors are required to confirm their subscription. This includes sending final “Welcome” email. To send final welcome emails, you need to:

 -  `Double Op-In must be enable for your campaign <http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/growth/opt-in-methods-for-offline-subscribers/>`__ and `the Welcome Email option must be enabled in your MailChimp account <http://kb.mailchimp.com/lists/signup-forms/enable-or-disable-final-welcome-email/>`__
 -   If you choose not to enable the Welcome Email option or have disabled Double Opn-In for your campaign, you need to `setup an automation workflow in MailChimp <http://kb.mailchimp.com/automation/add-an-automation/>`__ that sends an email once someone subscribes to your list.

Using a third-party domain ...
========

A domain name is the URL or web address where visitors find your landing page. With a BitBlox landing page, you can replace your built-in BitBlox domain (yourdomain.bitblox.me) with a custom domain.

Custom domains make it easy for visitors to find you on the web. Manage and connect your domains in the Domains panel. In the Home Menu, click Settings, and then click Domains.


Hosting
-----

Web hosting and domain hosting, though closely related, are two different services. Learn more about the differences and what Squarespace offers.


Connect domains purchased elsewhere
-----

To use a domain name or names you already own, or to use a TLD/extension we don’t currently support, you’ll follow a process called domain mapping. Visit the Connecting third-party domains guides for step-by-step connection help, information about built-in diagnosis and troubleshooting tools, and guides for adding subdomains.


Glossary
-----

Here are some common terms you may see when managing your domains with Squarespace.

A Record - A Records point a domain or subdomain to an IP address. When you map a third-party domain to your site, we recommend creating four A Records in your provider's DNS settings.
Built-in domain - Your Squarespace site comes with a built-in domain (with .squarespace.com at the end) using the name you gave on our signup page. Sometimes we'll use your name and a random string of numbers or letters as your built-in domain. You can change this built-in domain at any time.
CNAME Record - CNAME Records are used to alias one name to another. When mapping a domain to Squarespace, you’ll create two CNAME Records in your provider’s DNS Settings.
DNS - DNS are web servers that translate a website IP address into a legible domain name. When using a third-party domain with Squarespace, you’ll need to change DNS settings in your domain registrar’s account. Short for Domain Name Server (or System).
Domain privacy - Domain privacy is included with Squarespace domains at no additional cost. To protect your personal information, we can hide your name and contact details from WHOIS. With most registrars, domain privacy is a paid service that is added on to your subscription.
IP address - Your IP address is a unique number that represents your device on the Internet.
Nameserver - A nameserver is a specialized server that tells a browser where to go when your domain name is entered in the address bar. If you purchased a domain from a third party, you should keep your nameservers set to your provider's default settings.
Primary domain - Your primary domain is the main domain name always appears in a browser address bar no matter which domain a visitor used to open your site. You can change your primary domain at any time.
Subdomain - An extension of your domain name that forwards to your site. For example, help.squarespace.com and blog.squarespace.com are subdomains of squarespace.com.
TLD - Also known as a domain extension, a TLD (Top Level Domain) identifies the most general part of the domain name in an Internet address. The TLD always follows the last dot in a URL. For example, .com, .org, and .net are TLDs.
Who.is - A public internet record directory that provides information about all registered domains, including owner contact information, availability, and its registrar.


Understanding domains
-----


Before you begin
-----

* To follow this guide, you should already have registered a domain with a third-party provider. Once you connect your domain by following the steps in this guide, you must leave it registered with your provider to keep it connected to your BitBlox Landing Page.
Your domain provider must offer full DNS access. If they don't, you’ll need to transfer the domain to a new provider before connecting it to BitBlox.
You'll need to use your domain provider's default nameservers to successfully connect your domain to your BitBlox Landing Page .
If you have an email account linked to your custom domain, you can keep using it after connecting to BitBlox.
It's not possible to connect a custom domain to a specific page on your site. All connected domains will point to the site itself and resolve to the primary domain.
You can't connect a custom domain to BitBlox if the domain name has the word "BitBlox" in it.
Domains with special characters (such as ü, é, ñ) may not display properly on all browsers. If a browser can’t display the character, it will reformat the domain with extra characters and dashes. For example, the domain “übercool.de,” redirects to "xn--bercool-m2a.de” in unsupported browsers.

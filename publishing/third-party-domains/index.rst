Understanding domains
-----
A domain or domain name is the location of a website. Your domain name is a key part of your online address and is what your visitors will use to find you easily. Your domain name is unique to you, once you have registered it, nobody else can register the same one for as long as you continue to renew it. 
Your BitBlox Landing Page may have a built-in BitBlox domain (mylandingpage.bitblox.me) or you can replace with a custom domain from a third-party provider
	
	

Web Hosting
-----


Web hosting is a service that allows users to post a landing page on to the Internet. A web host, or web hosting service provider, is a business that provides the technologies and services needed for the website or landing page to be viewed in the internet.
Websites are hosted, or stored, on special computers called servers.

When you build a landing page with BitBlox, BitBlox is your web host. We provide a place on the Internet to display your content, in addition to tools for creating and managing that content.


Using a third-party domain 
----



If you purchased a domain from a third-pary provider (like GoDaddy, Namecheap or BlueHost), you can connect it to your landing page throught the process called domain mapping. Domain mapping is the process of pointing a registered domain name, like www.mynewproject.com to your new project on BitBlox platform.
In order to use Domain Mapping, your registrar must support Custom DNS services. Custom DNS gives you control over the DNS records that describe your domain, including the CNAME. For Domain Mapping you  must have the ability to create and modify CNAME records.



Before you begin
-----

To follow this guide, you should already have registered a domain with a third-party provider. Once you connect your domain by following the steps in this guide, you must leave it registered with your provider to keep it connected to your BitBlox Landing Page.

1. Your domain provider must offer full DNS access. If they don't, you’ll need to transfer the domain to a new provider before connecting it to BitBlox.
2. You'll need to use your domain provider's default nameservers to successfully connect your domain to your BitBlox Landing Page .
3. If you have an email account linked to your custom domain, you can keep using it after connecting to BitBlox.
4. It's not possible to connect a custom domain to a specific page on your site. All connected domains will point to the site itself and resolve to the primary domain.
5. You can't connect a custom domain to BitBlox if the domain name has the word "BitBlox" in it.
6. Domains with special characters (such as ü, é, ñ) may not display properly on all browsers. If a browser can’t display the character, it will reformat the domain with extra characters and dashes. For example, the domain “übercool.de,” redirects to "xn--bercool-m2a.de” in unsupported browsers.

Glossary
-----

* A Record - A Records point a domain or subdomain to an IP address. When you map a third-party domain to your site, we recommend creating four A Records in your provider's DNS settings.
* Built-in domain - Your BitBlox landing page comes with a built-in domain (with .bitblox.me at the end) using the name you gave on our signup page. You can change this built-in domain at any time.
* CNAME Record - CNAME Records are used to alias one name to another. When mapping a domain to BitBlox, you’ll create one CNAME Records in your provider’s DNS Settings.
* DNS - DNS are web servers that translate a website IP address into a legible domain name. When using a third-party domain with BitBlox, you’ll need to change DNS settings in your domain registrar’s account. Short for Domain Name Server (or System).
* Domain privacy - Domain privacy is included with Squarespace domains at no additional cost. To protect your personal information, we can hide your name and contact details from WHOIS. With most registrars, domain privacy is a paid service that is added on to your subscription.
* IP address - Your IP address is a unique number that represents your device on the Internet.
* Nameserver - A nameserver is a specialized server that tells a browser where to go when your domain name is entered in the address bar. If you purchased a domain from a third party, you should keep your nameservers set to your provider's default settings.
* Primary domain - Your primary domain is the main domain name always appears in a browser address bar no matter which domain a visitor used to open your site. You can change your primary domain at any time.
* Subdomain - An extension of your domain name that forwards to your site. For example, help.squarespace.com and blog.squarespace.com are subdomains of squarespace.com.
* TLD - Also known as a domain extension, a TLD (Top Level Domain) identifies the most general part of the domain name in an Internet address. The TLD always follows the last dot in a URL. For example, .com, .org, and .net are TLDs.
* Who.is - A public internet record directory that provides information about all registered domains, including owner contact information, availability, and its registrar.
